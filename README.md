## Next.js App Router

A project implementing basic Next.js features including data mutation, error handling, authentication... and more.

## Getting Started

This project built which `nextjs`, so you will need `node.js` installed globally on your machine.

## Installation and Setup

> [!NOTE]
> While you can run this project using npm, I highly recommend using [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/) as your package manager, as it's faster and more efficient than `npm` or `yarn`.


1. If you don't have pnpm installed, you can install it globally by running:
```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```   
2. Clone this repo:
```bash
https://github.com/NVHoaiDT/next-financial-dashboard
```
3. Install the dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```
4. Start the development server:
```bash
pnpm run dev
```
Now, try it out. You should be able to log in and out of your application using the following credentials:
- Email: user@nextmail.com
- Password: 123456

_Have a wonderful day! âœ¨_
